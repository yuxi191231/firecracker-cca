# Getting Started with Firecracker

**All resources are used for demonstration purposes and are not intended for
production.**

## Prerequisites

You can check if your system meets the requirements by running
`firecracker/tools/devtool checkenv`.

An opinionated way to run Firecracker is to launch an
[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) `c5.metal` instance with Ubuntu 22.04.

Firecracker requires [the KVM Linux kernel module](https://www.linux-kvm.org/)
to perform its virtualization and emulation tasks.

We exclusively use `.metal` instance types, because EC2 only supports KVM on
`.metal` instance types.

### Architecture & OS

Firecracker supports **x86_64** and **aarch64** Linux, see
[specific supported kernels](kernel-policy.md).

### KVM

Firecracker requires read/write access to `/dev/kvm` exposed by the KVM module.

The presence of the KVM module can be checked with:

```bash
lsmod | grep kvm
```

An example output where it is enabled:

```bash
kvm_intel             348160  0
kvm                   970752  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              16384  1 kvm
```

Some Linux distributions use the `kvm` group to manage access to `/dev/kvm`,
while others rely on access control lists. If you have the ACL package for your
distro installed, you can grant Read+Write access with:

```bash
sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm
```

If access is managed via the `kvm` group, check that the KVM group exists:

```bash
getent group kvm
```

and check that `/dev/kvm` is associated with the kvm group:

```bash
ls -l /dev/kvm
```

You can see if your current user is already in the kvm group by running:

```bash
groups
```

Otherwise, add your current user to the group by running:

```bash
[ $(stat -c "%G" /dev/kvm) = kvm ] && sudo usermod -aG kvm ${USER} \
&& echo "Access granted."
```

If none of the above works, you will need to either install the file system ACL
package for your distro and use the `setfacl` command as above, or run
Firecracker as `root` (via `sudo`).

You can check if you have access to `/dev/kvm` with:

```bash
[ -r /dev/kvm ] && [ -w /dev/kvm ] && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

## Running Firecracker

In production, Firecracker is designed to be run securely inside an execution
jail, set up by the [`jailer`](../src/jailer/) binary. This is how our
[integration test suite](#running-the-integration-test-suite) does it.

For simplicity, this guide will not use the [`jailer`](../src/jailer/).

### Getting a rootfs and Guest Kernel Image

To successfully start a microVM, you will need an uncompressed Linux kernel
binary, and an ext4 file system image (to use as rootfs). This guide uses a 5.10
kernel image with a Ubuntu 22.04 rootfs from our CI:

```bash
ARCH="$(uname -m)"

latest=$(wget "http://spec.ccfc.min.s3.amazonaws.com/?prefix=firecracker-ci/v1.10/x86_64/vmlinux-5.10&list-type=2" -O - 2>/dev/null | grep "(?<=<Key>)(firecracker-ci/v1.10/x86_64/vmlinux-5\.10\.[0-9]{3})(?=</Key>)" -o -P)

# Download a linux kernel binary
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/${latest}

# Download a rootfs
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/firecracker-ci/v1.10/${ARCH}/ubuntu-22.04.ext4

# Download the ssh key for the rootfs
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/firecracker-ci/v1.10/${ARCH}/ubuntu-22.04.id_rsa

# Set user read permission on the ssh key
chmod 400 ./ubuntu-22.04.id_rsa
```

### Getting a Firecracker Binary

There are two options for getting a firecracker binary:

- Downloading an official firecracker release from our
  [release page](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases),
  or
- Building firecracker from source.

To download the latest firecracker release, run:

```bash
ARCH="$(uname -m)"
release_url="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases"
latest=$(basename $(curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w  %{url_effective} ${release_url}/latest))
curl -L ${release_url}/download/${latest}/firecracker-${latest}-${ARCH}.tgz \
| tar -xz

# Rename the binary to "firecracker"
mv release-${latest}-$(uname -m)/firecracker-${latest}-${ARCH} firecracker
```

To instead build firecracker from source, you will need to have `docker`
installed:

```bash
ARCH="$(uname -m)"

# Clone the firecracker repository
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker firecracker_src

# Start docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Build firecracker
#
# It is possible to build for gnu, by passing the arguments '-l gnu'.
#
# This will produce the firecracker and jailer binaries under
# `./firecracker/build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug`.
#
sudo ./firecracker_src/tools/devtool build

# Rename the binary to "firecracker"
sudo cp ./firecracker_src/build/cargo_target/${ARCH}-unknown-linux-musl/debug/firecracker firecracker
```

### Starting Firecracker

Running firecracker will require two terminals, the first one running the
firecracker binary, and a second one for communicating with the firecracker
process via HTTP requests:

```bash
API_SOCKET="/tmp/firecracker.socket"

# Remove API unix socket
sudo rm -f $API_SOCKET

# Run firecracker
sudo ./firecracker --api-sock "${API_SOCKET}"
```

In a new terminal (do not close the 1st one):

```bash
TAP_DEV="tap0"
TAP_IP="172.16.0.1"
MASK_SHORT="/30"

# Setup network interface
sudo ip link del "$TAP_DEV" 2> /dev/null || true
sudo ip tuntap add dev "$TAP_DEV" mode tap
sudo ip addr add "${TAP_IP}${MASK_SHORT}" dev "$TAP_DEV"
sudo ip link set dev "$TAP_DEV" up

# Enable ip forwarding
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

HOST_IFACE="eth0"

# Set up microVM internet access
sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o "$HOST_IFACE" -j MASQUERADE || true
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT \
    || true
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -i "$TAP_DEV" -o "$HOST_IFACE" -j ACCEPT || true
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o "$HOST_IFACE" -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i "$TAP_DEV" -o "$HOST_IFACE" -j ACCEPT

API_SOCKET="/tmp/firecracker.socket"
LOGFILE="./firecracker.log"

# Create log file
touch $LOGFILE

# Set log file
sudo curl -X PUT --unix-socket "${API_SOCKET}" \
    --data "{
        \"log_path\": \"${LOGFILE}\",
        \"level\": \"Debug\",
        \"show_level\": true,
        \"show_log_origin\": true
    }" \
    "http://localhost/logger"

KERNEL="./$(ls vmlinux* | tail -1)"
KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS="console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off"

ARCH=$(uname -m)

if [ ${ARCH} = "aarch64" ]; then
    KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS="keep_bootcon ${KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS}"
fi

# Set boot source
sudo curl -X PUT --unix-socket "${API_SOCKET}" \
    --data "{
        \"kernel_image_path\": \"${KERNEL}\",
        \"boot_args\": \"${KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS}\"
    }" \
    "http://localhost/boot-source"

ROOTFS="./ubuntu-22.04.ext4"

# Set rootfs
sudo curl -X PUT --unix-socket "${API_SOCKET}" \
    --data "{
        \"drive_id\": \"rootfs\",
        \"path_on_host\": \"${ROOTFS}\",
        \"is_root_device\": true,
        \"is_read_only\": false
    }" \
    "http://localhost/drives/rootfs"

# The IP address of a guest is derived from its MAC address with
# `fcnet-setup.sh`, this has been pre-configured in the guest rootfs. It is
# important that `TAP_IP` and `FC_MAC` match this.
FC_MAC="06:00:AC:10:00:02"

# Set network interface
sudo curl -X PUT --unix-socket "${API_SOCKET}" \
    --data "{
        \"iface_id\": \"net1\",
        \"guest_mac\": \"$FC_MAC\",
        \"host_dev_name\": \"$TAP_DEV\"
    }" \
    "http://localhost/network-interfaces/net1"

# API requests are handled asynchronously, it is important the configuration is
# set, before `InstanceStart`.
sleep 0.015s

# Start microVM
sudo curl -X PUT --unix-socket "${API_SOCKET}" \
    --data "{
        \"action_type\": \"InstanceStart\"
    }" \
    "http://localhost/actions"

# API requests are handled asynchronously, it is important the microVM has been
# started before we attempt to SSH into it.
sleep 2s

# Setup internet access in the guest
ssh -i ./ubuntu-22.04.id_rsa root@172.16.0.2  "ip route add default via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0"

# Setup DNS resolution in the guest
ssh -i ./ubuntu-22.04.id_rsa root@172.16.0.2  "echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf"

# SSH into the microVM
ssh -i ./ubuntu-22.04.id_rsa root@172.16.0.2

# Use `root` for both the login and password.
# Run `reboot` to exit.
```

Issuing a `reboot` command inside the guest will gracefully shutdown
Firecracker. This is due to the fact that Firecracker doesn't implement guest
power management.

### Configuring the microVM without sending API requests

You can boot a guest without using the API socket by passing the parameter
`--config-file` to the Firecracker process. E.g.:

```wrap
sudo ./firecracker --api-sock /tmp/firecracker.socket --config-file <path_to_the_configuration_file>
```

`path_to_the_configuration_file` is the path to a JSON file with the
configuration for all of the microVM's resources. The JSON **must** contain the
configuration for the guest kernel and rootfs, all of the other resources are
optional. This configuration method will also start the microVM, as such you
need to specify all desired pre-boot configurable resources in the JSON. The
names of the resources can be seen in \[`firecracker.yaml`\]
(../src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml) and the names of their fields are
the same that are used in the API requests.

An example of configuration file is provided:
[`tests/framework/vm_config.json`](../tests/framework/vm_config.json).

Once the guest is booted, refer [network-setup](./network-setup.md#in-the-guest)
to bring up the network in the guest machine.

After the microVM is started you can still use the socket to send API requests
for post-boot operations.

### Building Firecracker

SSH can be used to work with libraries from private git repos by passing the
`--ssh-keys` flag to specify the paths to your public and private SSH keys on
the host. Both are required for git authentication when fetching the
repositories.

```bash
tools/devtool build --ssh-keys ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Only a single set of credentials is supported. `devtool` cannot fetch multiple
private repos which rely on different credentials.

`tools/devtool build` builds in `debug` to build release binaries pass
`--release` e.g. `tools/devtool build --release`

Documentation on `devtool` can be seen with `tools/devtool --help`.

## Running the Integration Test Suite

Integration tests can be run with `tools/devtool test`.

The test suite is designed to ensure our [SLA parameters](../SPECIFICATION.md)
as measured on EC2 .metal instances, as such performance tests may fail when not
run on these machines. Specifically, don't be alarmed if you see
`tests/integration_tests/performance/test_process_startup_time.py` failing when
not run on an EC2 .metal instance. You can skip performance tests with:

```bash
./tools/devtool test -- --ignore integration_tests/performance
```

If you run the integration tests on an EC2 .metal instance, and encounter
failures such as the following

`FAILED integration_tests/style/test_markdown.py::test_markdown_style -  requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='169.254.169.254', port=80): Read timed out. (read timeout=2)`

try running
`aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-id i-<your  instance id> --http-put-response-hop-limit 2`.
The integration tests framework uses IMDSv2 to determine information such as
instance type. The additional hop is needed because the IMDS requests will pass
through docker.

## Errors while using `curl` to access the API

Points to check to confirm the API socket is running and accessible:

- Check that the user running the Firecracker process and the user using `curl`
  have equivalent privileges. For example, if you run Firecracker with **sudo**
  that you run `curl` with **sudo** as well.
- [SELinux](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/selinux.8.html) can regulate
  access to sockets on RHEL based distributions. How user's permissions are
  configured is environmentally specific, but for the purposes of
  troubleshooting you can check if it is enabled in `/etc/selinux/config`.
- With the Firecracker process running using
  `--api-sock /tmp/firecracker.socket`, confirm that the socket is open:
  - `ss -a | grep '/tmp/firecracker.socket'`
  - If you have socat available, try
    `socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/firecracker.socket` This will throw an explicit
    error if the socket is inaccessible, or it will pause and wait for input to
    continue.
