//! Defines the metrics system for block devices.
//!
//! # Metrics format
//! The metrics are flushed in JSON when requested by vmm::logger::metrics::METRICS.write().
//!
//! ## JSON example with metrics:
//! ```json
//! {
//!  "block_drv0": {
//!     "activate_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "cfg_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "no_avail_buffer": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "event_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "execute_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     ...
//!  }
//!  "block_drv1": {
//!     "activate_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "cfg_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "no_avail_buffer": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "event_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "execute_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     ...
//!  }
//!  ...
//!  "block_drive_id": {
//!     "activate_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "cfg_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "no_avail_buffer": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "event_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "execute_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     ...
//!  }
//!  "block": {
//!     "activate_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "cfg_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "no_avail_buffer": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "event_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     "execute_fails": "SharedIncMetric",
//!     ...
//!  }
//! }
//! ```
//! Each `block` field in the example above is a serializable `BlockDeviceMetrics` structure
//! collecting metrics such as `activate_fails`, `cfg_fails`, etc. for the block device.
//! `block_drv0` represent metrics for the endpoint "/drives/drv0",
//! `block_drv1` represent metrics for the endpoint "/drives/drv1", and
//! `block_drive_id` represent metrics for the endpoint "/drives/{drive_id}"
//! block device respectively and `block` is the aggregate of all the per device metrics.
//!
//! # Limitations
//! block device currently do not have `vmm::logger::metrics::StoreMetrics` so aggregate
//! doesn't consider them.
//!
//! # Design
//! The main design goals of this system are:
//! * To improve block device metrics by logging them at per device granularity.
//! * Continue to provide aggregate block metrics to maintain backward compatibility.
//! * Move BlockDeviceMetrics out of from logger and decouple it.
//! * Rely on `serde` to provide the actual serialization for writing the metrics.
//! * Since all metrics start at 0, we implement the `Default` trait via derive for all of them, to
//!   avoid having to initialize everything by hand.
//!
//! * Devices could be created in any order i.e. the first device created could either be drv0 or
//!   drv1 so if we use a vector for BlockDeviceMetrics and call 1st device as block0, then block0
//!   could sometimes point to drv0 and sometimes to drv1 which doesn't help with analysing the
//!   metrics. So, use Map instead of Vec to help understand which drive the metrics actually
//!   belongs to.
//!
//! The system implements 1 type of metrics:
//! * Shared Incremental Metrics (SharedIncMetrics) - dedicated for the metrics which need a counter
//! (i.e the number of times an API request failed). These metrics are reset upon flush.
//! We add BlockDeviceMetrics entries from block::metrics::METRICS into Block device instead of
//! Block device having individual separate BlockDeviceMetrics entries because Block device is not
//! accessible from signal handlers to flush metrics and block::metrics::METRICS is.
