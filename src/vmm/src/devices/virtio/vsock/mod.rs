//! The Firecracker vsock device aims to provide full virtio-vsock support to
//! software running inside the guest VM, while bypassing vhost kernel code on the
//! host. To that end, Firecracker implements the virtio-vsock device model, and
//! mediates communication between AF_UNIX sockets (on the host end) and AF_VSOCK
//! sockets (on the guest end).
