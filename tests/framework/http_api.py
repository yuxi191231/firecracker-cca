        # that request with an already existing connection from the pool, by
        # comparing their url.
        # If there's a match, then the adapter uses the connection from the
        # pool to make the new request.
        # Otherwise, a new connection is created and saved in the pool. If
        # there is no space in the pool, the new connection will replace the
        # least recently used one in the pool. The evicted connection will be
        # closed.

        # The `pool_connections` argument indicates the maximum number of
        # connection saved in the pool, not the maximum number of open

        # We set this value to be equal to micro-http's `MAX_CONNECTIONS` - 1.
        # This is because when reaching the `pool_connection` limit, it is not
        # guaranteed that the event to close the connection will be received
        # before the event that results in creating a new connection (this
        # depends on the kernel). In case the two events are not received in
        # the same order, or are received together, the server might try to add
        # a new connection before removing the old one, resulting in a
        # `SERVER_FULL_ERROR`.
