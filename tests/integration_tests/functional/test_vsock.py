"""Tests for the virtio-vsock device.

In order to test the vsock device connection state machine, these tests will:
- Generate a 20MiB random data blob;
- Use `socat` to start a listening echo server inside the guest VM;
- Run 50, concurrent, host-initiated connections, each transfering the random
  blob to and from the guest echo server;
- For every connection, check that the data received back from the echo server
  hashes to the same value as the data sent;
- Start a host echo server, and repeat the process for the same number of
  guest-initiated connections.
